# Drug-Screening

Python scripts to preapre serial dilutions and drug combinations calculation for bioassays. Input requires a table containing desired drug mixtures to be prepared (mixing_matrix.csv) and drug doses/stock (dose_matrix_stock.csv). See below for further details and example files.  

Usage example:

```bash

    Usage example:

    python dilution.py 3 200 Sample_Input_Files/mixing_matrix.csv Sample_Input_Files/dose_matrix_stock.csv

    - 3 is the number of replicates
    - 200 is the assay volume
    - mixing_matrix.csv is the file containing the experimental drug combinations where each row represents a specific drug and each 
        column represent a different drug combination. Drug concentrations are represented as coefficient (or coded concentrations). 
    - dose_matrix_stock.csv is the file containing the dosing information for each drug (real concentations corresponding to coded concentrations) and 
        the initial stock concentration for each drug
    
    See example input files for formatting example. 

        NOTE: if some drugs have fewer than the maximum number of concentrations, always use the highest coded concentrations possible
        and leave empty lower concentrations. In example, drug 1 has only 1 dose and drug 2 has 3 doses
        i.e.
               Dose 1   Dose2   Dose3
        Drug 1  0       0       5
        Drug 2  1       2       5

    Outputs:
    mixture_medium.csv - when preparing final mixtures or drugs (by column corresponding to mixing_matrix.csv), volume of medium

    The base volume is printed to the terminal. This represent the volume of each drug dose to be added to each mixture. 
        i.e. combinations are represented by each column of the mixing matrix. A combinations is composed of each drug at a predefined concentration. 
        To prepare each combination, the mixture_medium volume (from mixture_medium.csv) is added to each vial followed by the volume (base_volume) 
        of each drug at the specified dose. 

    Three output .csv files are generated by this script. 
    For preparing serial dilutions:
    dilution_volume_stock.csv - volume of stock solution or next highest drug concentration for preparing serial dilution
    dilution_volume_medium.csv - volume of medium to be added to each tube for serial dilutions

    Experimentally: 
    1) Prepare serial dilutions:
        - add dilution_volume_medium.csv
        - make serial dilutions by adding volume of stock or next highest drug dose to the subsequent dilution vial based on dilution_volume_stock.csv
    2) Prepare drug combinations
        - add medium volume to each combination vial based on mixture_medium.csv
        - add each drug to the mixture (add a volume of 'base_volume' of each drug at the specified dose to each tube)
