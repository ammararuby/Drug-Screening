# Drug-Screening
Python scripts for drug combinations and experimental dilution calculation. 
Dilution_matrix:
Using a toy drug combination matrix, this script calculates:
1. occurrence of each drug/dose pair and the corresponding volume of drugs needed.
2. given specified concentrations for each drug, calculates the dilution factors to get to each concentration starting from the stock concentration.
3. Calculates stock and medium volumes needed for serially diluting to each specified concentration.
